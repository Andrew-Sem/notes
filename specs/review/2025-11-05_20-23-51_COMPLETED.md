## Issue #1: [technical_detail][high] Technical architecture mentioned in project description
**Files:** specs/prd.md:11-14
**Evidence:**
```
specs/prd.md:11-14:
Основные возможности:
- **Telegram Bot** — пользователи отправляют текст, фото, видео и документы боту для быстрого сохранения заметок
- **Telegram Mini App** — веб-интерфейс внутри Telegram для просмотра, организации и поиска заметок
- **AI-помощник** (будущая фаза) — интеллектуальный поиск и автоматические подсказки для организации заметок
```

**Issue:** This section uses technical component names (Telegram Bot, Mini App, веб-интерфейс) instead of describing product capabilities from user perspective. PRD should focus on WHAT users can do, not HOW the system is structured.

**Options:**
- A) Rewrite to focus on user capabilities: "Key Features: Quick Capture - save thoughts instantly by sending them to Telegram; Browse & Organize - view and manage all notes in one place; AI Assistant (future) - intelligent search and organization suggestions"
- B) Remove technical component names and describe user journeys instead
- C) Move this section to a Technical Architecture document and keep only user-facing features in PRD
- D) Other (custom resolution)

**Resolution:** [RESOLUTION: SKIP]

## Issue #2: [language_inconsistency][medium] Mixed languages in document
**Files:** specs/prd.md:11-14, specs/prd.md:36-38, specs/prd.md:186
**Evidence:**
```
specs/prd.md:11: Основные возможности:
specs/prd.md:36: - Данные пользователей надежно защищены через аутентификацию Telegram
specs/prd.md:186: - **FR-009**: Список заметок отображает превью фотографий
```

**Issue:** Document mixes English and Russian text. PRD states "Supported Languages: English" but contains Russian text throughout.

**Options:**
- A) Translate all Russian text to English for consistency
- B) Keep Russian since it's the working language, update language specification to "Russian"
- C) Create bilingual version with both languages
- D) Other (custom resolution)

**Resolution:** [RESOLUTION: A]

---

## Issue #3: [technical_detail][high] Implementation-specific file size limit
**Files:** specs/prd.md:188-189
**Evidence:**
```
specs/prd.md:188-189:
- **FR-011**: Product supports files up to 20 MB. Larger files are rejected with notification to user.
```

**Issue:** Specific technical limit (20 MB) is an implementation detail. PRD should state business requirement, not technical constraint. This belongs in Technical Specification.

**Options:**
- A) Replace with business requirement: "Product supports files of reasonable size for typical user content (photos, documents, short videos). Files exceeding limits are rejected with clear guidance."
- B) State user need instead: "Users can upload common file types without worrying about size limits for typical use cases"
- C) Remove specific number and add to constraints section: "File size limits defined by Telegram platform capabilities"
- D) Other (custom resolution)

**Resolution:** [RESOLUTION: SKIP]

---

## Issue #4: [technical_detail][medium] Technical authentication mechanism mentioned
**Files:** specs/prd.md:36
**Evidence:**
```
specs/prd.md:36:
- Данные пользователей надежно защищены через аутентификацию Telegram
```

**Issue:** Mentions specific authentication mechanism (Telegram authentication). PRD should state security requirement from user perspective, not implementation method.

**Options:**
- A) Rewrite as user benefit: "User data is securely protected - only the account owner can access their notes"
- B) Generalize: "Secure authentication ensures each user accesses only their own notes"
- C) Move to security requirements without specifying Telegram: "Users are automatically authenticated when accessing the system"
- D) Other (custom resolution)

**Resolution:** [RESOLUTION: A]

---

## Issue #5: [technical_detail][high] Technical infrastructure mentioned (encryption)
**Files:** specs/prd.md:37
**Evidence:**
```
specs/prd.md:37:
- Все сохраненные данные зашифрованы
```

**Issue:** "Data encryption" is an implementation detail. PRD should focus on user privacy guarantee, not technical method.

**Options:**
- A) Rewrite as user privacy guarantee: "All saved notes are kept private and secure"
- B) Focus on outcome: "User data is protected from unauthorized access"
- C) Move encryption details to Technical Security Specification
- D) Other (custom resolution)

**Resolution:** [RESOLUTION: SKIP]

---

## Issue #6: [technical_detail][high] Technical UI implementation mentioned (responsive design)
**Files:** specs/prd.md:49
**Evidence:**
```
specs/prd.md:49:
- Web interface must be responsive for all screen sizes (responsive design)
```

**Issue:** "Responsive design" is a technical implementation approach. PRD should describe user experience, not technical solution.

**Options:**
- A) Rewrite as user experience: "Interface adapts seamlessly to any device screen size - phone, tablet, or desktop"
- B) Focus on capability: "Users can access and manage notes comfortably on any device"
- C) Remove "(responsive design)" technical term, keep only the requirement
- D) Other (custom resolution)

**Resolution:** [RESOLUTION: SKIP]

---

## Issue #7: [technical_detail][medium] Technical performance metric
**Files:** specs/prd.md:58
**Evidence:**
```
specs/prd.md:58:
- However, Mini App should have fast loading: initial load < 2 seconds
```

**Issue:** Specific technical metric "< 2 seconds" is an implementation constraint. PRD should state user expectation.

**Options:**
- A) Replace with user expectation: "App loads quickly so users can start working immediately"
- B) Use qualitative measure: "Interface loads fast enough that users don't experience noticeable delays"
- C) Move technical metrics to Technical Performance Requirements document
- D) Other (custom resolution)

**Resolution:** [RESOLUTION: D - Remove this requirement entirely]

---

## Issue #8: [technical_detail][medium] API/technical terminology in user stories
**Files:** specs/prd.md:244
**Evidence:**
```
specs/prd.md:244:
- **FR-014**: /open command sends inline button to open Telegram Mini App
```

**Issue:** "inline button" is technical UI implementation detail. PRD should describe user action.

**Options:**
- A) Rewrite as user capability: "/open command provides a button to access the note management interface"
- B) Focus on outcome: "/open command allows user to quickly access their notes"
- C) Remove technical UI terminology and describe user experience
- D) Other (custom resolution)

**Resolution:** [RESOLUTION: D - Replace with: "Users can open the note management interface through a button in Telegram" (remove /open command - commands should not be described in PRD, use Telegram's app button functionality instead)]

---

## Issue #9: [technical_detail][high] Technical implementation in feature requirements
**Files:** specs/prd.md:316
**Evidence:**
```
specs/prd.md:316:
- **FR-018**: More notes load smoothly as user scrolls
```

**Issue:** While user-focused, this implies technical implementation (infinite scroll/pagination). Later in AC-011 it specifically mentions "automatically loaded" which is implementation detail.

**Options:**
- A) Keep as-is since it describes user experience adequately
- B) Make more generic: "Users can browse all their notes without performance degradation regardless of total count"
- C) Focus on capability only: "Users can access all their notes conveniently"
- D) Other (custom resolution)

**Resolution:** [RESOLUTION: A]

---

## Issue #10: [technical_detail][medium] Character limits are implementation constraints
**Files:** specs/prd.md:445, specs/prd.md:448
**Evidence:**
```
specs/prd.md:445:
- **FR-028**: Users can create folders with custom names (up to 50 characters). Folders cannot be placed inside other folders.

specs/prd.md:448:
- **FR-031**: User can add multiple tags to note (up to 10 tags, each tag max 30 characters including emojis)
```

**Issue:** Specific character/count limits (50 characters, 10 tags, 30 characters) are technical constraints, not product requirements. These should be in Technical Specifications.

**Options:**
- A) Remove specific numbers: "Users can create folders with meaningful names" and "Users can add multiple tags to notes"
- B) Use qualitative limits: "Folder names should be concise" and "Reasonable number of tags per note"
- C) Move to constraints section as technical implementation details
- D) Other (custom resolution)

**Resolution:** [RESOLUTION: SKIP]

---

## Issue #11: [technical_detail][medium] Technical search implementation details
**Files:** specs/prd.md:360, specs/prd.md:364
**Evidence:**
```
specs/prd.md:360:
- **FR-022**: Search responds smoothly as user types, showing results instantly

specs/prd.md:364:
- **FR-026**: Search supports partial word matching (e.g., "progr" will find "programming")
```

**Issue:** FR-022 describes technical implementation (real-time search as you type). FR-026 describes search algorithm behavior. PRD should focus on user capability.

**Options:**
- A) Rewrite FR-022: "Search helps users find notes quickly" and FR-026: "Search is flexible - finds notes even with partial information"
- B) Combine into single user benefit: "Search finds relevant notes instantly, even with incomplete words"
- C) Keep as-is since they describe user experience adequately
- D) Other (custom resolution)

**Resolution:** [RESOLUTION: C]

---

## Issue #12: [technical_detail][low] Technical editor implementation mentioned
**Files:** specs/prd.md:511
**Evidence:**
```
specs/prd.md:511:
- **FR-038**: When editing text editor opens with ability to change content
```

**Issue:** "text editor opens" describes technical UI implementation. PRD should focus on capability.

**Options:**
- A) Rewrite: "Users can modify note content using an editing interface"
- B) Simplify: "Users can change note text and save modifications"
- C) Keep as-is since "text editor" is user-understandable term
- D) Other (custom resolution)

**Resolution:** [RESOLUTION: SKIP]

---

## Issue #13: [technical_detail][medium] Cache implementation detail mentioned
**Files:** specs/prd.md:583
**Evidence:**
```
specs/prd.md:583:
- **FR-045**: Summaries are generated once and retrieved instantly on subsequent views
```

**Issue:** "retrieved instantly on subsequent views" implies caching implementation. PRD should describe user experience.

**Options:**
- A) Rewrite: "Once generated, summaries are immediately available whenever user views the note"
- B) Focus on user benefit: "Summaries are saved with the note for quick access"
- C) Remove implementation hint: "Generated summaries are stored and remain available"
- D) Other (custom resolution)

**Resolution:** [RESOLUTION: D - Remove summary functionality entirely - it's post-MVP]

---

## Issue #14: [technical_detail][medium] Technical AI service architecture implied
**Files:** specs/prd.md:666
**Evidence:**
```
specs/prd.md:666:
- **FR-052**: Search understands context and intent to surface the most relevant notes
```

**Issue:** While describing capability, the phrasing "understands context and intent to surface" implies AI/ML implementation details.

**Options:**
- A) Rewrite for user clarity: "Search finds notes based on meaning, not just exact words - helping users locate information even when they don't remember exact phrasing"
- B) Keep as-is since it adequately describes user benefit
- C) Simplify: "Search provides intelligent results based on what user is looking for"
- D) Other (custom resolution)

**Resolution:** [RESOLUTION: B]

---

## Issue #15: [missing_info][medium] Unclear scope boundary for media captions
**Files:** specs/prd.md:187
**Evidence:**
```
specs/prd.md:187:
- **FR-010**: Media messages with captions are saved with their text. Media without captions can be found using date, type, folders, and tags.
```

**Issue:** This requirement mixes two different concepts but doesn't clarify: Are captions searchable? Are they editable? This creates ambiguity about caption functionality.

**Options:**
- A) Split into two requirements: FR-010a for caption saving, FR-010b for media discoverability, with clear statement if captions are searchable
- B) Clarify: "Media messages with captions are saved with their text (captions are searchable). Media without captions can be found using date, type, folders, and tags."
- C) Expand to user story format to make capabilities clear
- D) Other (custom resolution)

**Resolution:** [RESOLUTION: SKIP]
